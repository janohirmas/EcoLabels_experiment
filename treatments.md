# Treatments

## Sustainability Sets:
1. Most relevant set: $ S_1 = \{ (1,2),(2,3),(1,3)\} $
2. Equal set: $ S_2 = \{ (1,1),(2,2),(3,3) \} $

## Quality Sets: 
We define 3 sets of Quality pairs:
    * Competing Quality: $ Q_c = \{ (2,1),(3,1),(3,2) \}$
    * Supporting Quality: $ Q_s = \{ (1,2),(1,3),(2,3) \}$
    * Equal Quality $ Q_e = \{ (1,1),(2,2),(3,3) \}$

## Price Sets: 
We define 3 sets for Price pairs:
        * Alternative more expensive: $ P_{OE} = {(p_2,p_1),(p_3,p_1),(p_3,p_2)} $
        * Sustainable more expensive: $ P_{SE} = {(p_1,p_2),(p_1,p_3),(p_2,p_3)} $
        * Equal prices $ P_{EQ} = \{(p_1,p_1),(p_2,p_2),(p_3,p_3)\} $

## Trials:
Participants will do **66 trials in total** (33 before and after the information). 
- The trials before and after will be the same for each participant
- the order of these trials will be randomized for each participant. 
- The order of the attributes will be randomized for each participant, but then it will be constant across trials. The possible orders will be (Price, Quality, Sustainability) or (Price, Sustainability, Quality). We keep Price first to keep resemblance to what a consumer would observe in a webshop. 

1. For each  $s\in S_1$ we combine **twice** ($ N=20$): 
    - Competing Quality and Alternative more expensive 
        * We use one combination $ (q,p) \in Q_c \times P_{OE} $
    - Competing Quality and Sustainable option more expensive
        * We use one combination $ (q,p) \in Q_c \times P_{SE} $
    - Supporting Quality and Sustainable option more expensive
        * We use one combination $ (q,p) \in Q_s \times P_{SE} $
    - Equal Quality and Sustainable option more expensive
        * We use one combination $ (q,p) \in Q_{e} \times P_{SE} $
    - Competing Quality and Equal Price
        * We use one combination $ (q,p) \in Q_c \times P_{EQ} $
3.  For each $s \in S_2$ we use High Quality and High Price  ($ N = 3 $): 
    * We use one combination $ (q,p) \in Q_c \times P_{OE}$
    
## Decision Times
- Read Instructions (5 minutes)
- Main Task, block 1 (7-10 minutes)
- Read additional information (2-5 minutes)
- Main Task, block 2 (7-10 minutes)
- Questionnaire (10 minutes)

Total Time: 31-40 minutes

If alternatively, we show 1 combination for $S_0$, then the time would reduce to 26-32 minutes.
